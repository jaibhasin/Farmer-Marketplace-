# Marketplace for Farmers

## üöÄ About the Project

Marketplace for Farmers is a bilingual (English/Hindi) platform connecting farmers directly with buyers while empowering farmers with smart technology. Farmers can list their produce and access AI-powered crop recommendations, fertilizer advice, and real-time Mandi prices. Buyers can easily find crops across different states and connect with transportation services. The platform aims to modernize agricultural trade while keeping it accessible and farmer-friendly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### For Farmers:

- **Crop Listing:** Farmers can list their crops along with details like quantity, location, pincode, and price per quintal.
- **Get Crop Recommendation Model:** Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental factors using machine learning.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation Model:** Recommends optimal fertilizers based on soil nutrient levels and desired crop to grow.
- **Mandi Prices:** Provides the latest market prices using a government API.
- **Crop Timeline:** Offers detailed crop timelines to assist farmers in planning their agricultural activities.
- **Weather Forecast Links:** Directs farmers to trusted weather forecast channels for better planning.

### For Buyers:

- **Crop Selection:** Buyers can select crops and quantities, and the platform lists available farmers along with their prices and locations.
- **Transportation Assistance:** Includes a curated list of transportation companies to ease logistics.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Client Side:** Express.js
- **Server Side:** Flask
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Models

### 1. **Crop Recommendation Model**

- **Purpose:** Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall).
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- **Key Features:**
  - Majority voting mechanism for robust predictions.
  - Data preprocessing with LabelEncoder and StandardScaler.
  - Accuracy and reliability evaluation with metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrices.
  - Deployment with pickle for efficient model reuse.
  - Trained on [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 
### 2. **Fertilizer Recommendation Model**

- **Purpose:** Suggests the appropriate fertilizers based on soil nutrient levels and crop requirements.
- **Key Features:**
  - Analyzes soil Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels.
  - Recommends fertilizers to address nutrient deficiencies dynamically.
  - Trained on [Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv)
